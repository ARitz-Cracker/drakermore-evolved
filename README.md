# Drakermore: Evolved
Drakermore is a live [packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/) kinda thing. Originally prototyped by [Drake](https://github.com/ihatecsv/) with some additions + Rust rewrite by [Aritz](https://github.com/ARitz-Cracker/)

## Why?
- we wanted to host a Minecraft server
- we wanted our non-technical friends to have minimal hassle
- we wanted to easily have our client mod versions match the server version
- packwiz is great, tho it's not live
- moddermore is/was kinda unreliable
- downloading mods and moving files around manually is cringe

## How do I use it?
Figure it out, then submit a PR on how you figured it out. I made this for my own enjoyment and don't intend to "support" it beyond having it work for my friends and I.
